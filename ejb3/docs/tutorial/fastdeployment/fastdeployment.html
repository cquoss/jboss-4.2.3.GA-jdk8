<h2>Fast Deployment using DeployEjb3ExtensionOnly</h2>

</p><p>
In order to deploy EJB3s, all .jar files must be examined for the existence of annotated classes and 
EJB3 style deployment descriptors. This can significantly slow the deployment if there are large numbers
of .jar files, xml descriptors, and classes that need to be examined. In order to provide a mechanism to
speed the deployment time in these scenarios, JBoss EJB3 provides a flag which will cause the EJB3 
deployer to only examine .ejb3 files for the existence of annotated classes and EJB3 style deployment
descriptors. 
</p><p>
Take a look at <a href="META-INF/jboss-service.xml">jboss-service.xml</a>. This file is found in the
<tt>deploy/ejb3.deployer</tt> directory. The <tt>jboss.ejb3:service=EJB3Deployer</tt> mbean configuration
contains a <tt>DeployEjb3ExtensionOnly</tt> attribute. The default value for this atrribute is <tt>false</tt>,
which indicates that all .jar files should be examined for annotated classes and EJB3 style deployment
descriptors. Setting the value to <tt>true</tt> will cause the EJB3 deployer to only examine files with
.ejb3 extensions.
